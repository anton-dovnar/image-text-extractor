# Image Text Extractor

## Project Description

In this project, we'll develop a web application using Django, an open-source Python framework designed for building secure and maintainable backend systems. Our application will focus on text extraction, leveraging Pytesseract, a Python-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, to identify and extract text from images and PDFs.

Users will be able to upload images or PDF files, which will then be saved to a specified location on the server. Tesseract, the OCR engine integrated into our application, will handle the extraction of text from these uploaded files, facilitating efficient text retrieval from both hand-written and digitally printed content.
